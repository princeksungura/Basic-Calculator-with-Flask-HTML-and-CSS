Description:
This repository hosts a web application that generates random numbers using Flask for the backend, along with HTML and CSS for the user interface. The generator allows users to specify the range for the random number and provides a dynamic display of the generated result without needing a page reload.

Key Features:

Solely relies on Flask, HTML, and CSS for implementation.
Enables users to specify a range for random number generation.
Presents a clean and intuitive user interface with input fields for number range selection.
Displays the generated random number dynamically on the same page.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure Flask is installed (pip install Flask).
Run the Flask application and access it through a web browser.
This project serves as an example of a random number generator implemented using Flask for backend processing and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It illustrates the fundamentals of combining a Python-based backend with minimalistic frontend technologies to create a functional web application.

Note: Further enhancements can be made, such as incorporating additional features like seeding options, refining the user interface, or implementing error handling for different scenarios.
