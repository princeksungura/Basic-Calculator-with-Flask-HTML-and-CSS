# Basic Calculator with Flask, HTML, and CSS

Description:
This repository contains a simple calculator web application built using Flask, HTML, and CSS. The calculator offers basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two user-inputted numbers. The Flask backend handles the calculations based on the selected operation, delivering the result back to the user interface without requiring a page reload.

Key Features:

Utilizes Flask, HTML, and CSS exclusively.
Offers addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functionalities.
Provides a clean and straightforward user interface with two input fields and a select dropdown for operations.
Displays the calculated result dynamically on the same page.
Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Flask installed (pip install Flask).
Run the Flask application and access it through a web browser.
This project serves as a demonstration of a basic calculator implemented using Flask for backend processing and HTML/CSS for the user interface. It showcases the foundational concepts of building a web application with minimalistic frontend technologies and a Python-based backend.

Note: Enhancements and expansions can be made, such as adding more complex operations, improving the user interface, or implementing error handling for edge cases.
